Module: Graph Theory, Summer 21/22 Assessment.

Student: Natan Trosman - G00347770.

Lecturer: Dr. Ian McLoughlin.

## Introduction.
***
This Repository contains everything for my end of year assesment in Graph Theory (Summer 2021/2022). The purpose of this notebook is to show what iv'e learned throughout the year in this module.

### Prerequisites.
***
If you would like to change or alter anything in these notebooks, you'll have to install jupyter notebook first. Otherwise you can view the files through github

Jupyter Notebook Installation :https://test-jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/rtd-theme/install.html#:~:text=Prerequisite%3A%20Jupyter%20installation%20requires%20Python,package%20manager%2C%20or%20using%20Anaconda.
(Once you have Jupyter installed, clone the repository on your local machine and use the command "jupyter notebook" to launch and edit these files in your browser)

### Contents.
***
#### Heap Sort Notebook:
• Explanation of the Heap Sort algorithm
• Python function implementing Heap Sort.
• Explanation of the computational complexity of Heap Sort.
• Explanation of how graph theory is used in Heap Sort

#### Graph Isomorphism Problem Notebook:
• Explanation of the Graph Iomorphism Problem.
• Explanation of how graphs can be represented in data structures.
• Python function implementing an algorithm to determine if two graphs are isomorphic or not.
• Discussion of the computational complexity of the Graph Isomorphism Problem.

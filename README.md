Introduction.
This Repository contains everything for my end of year assesment in Graph Theory (Summer 2021/2022). The purpose of this notebook is to show what iv'e learned throughout this module, my understanding, and to demonstrate Graph theory and what it does for Computer Science and Math.

Prerequisites.
If you would like to change or alter anything in these notebooks, you'll have to install jupyter notebook first. Otherwise you can view the files through github
